# Liveheats Tech Test

## Description

This web-based system is designed to help teachers at a local school manage race day results for students. It allows teachers to set up races, assign students to lanes, record their finishing places, and view the results.

I have made a conscious choice not to include tests in my SETUP, README, and Migration commits. The rest of this app is TDD

## Features Implemented

**Race Setup**:
* Teachers can create new races.
* Teachers can assign students to specific lanes for each race.
* A race requires at least 2 students to be set up.
* The app prevents assigning the same student to multiple lanes in the same race.
* The app prevents assigning different students to the same lane in the same race.
  
**Result Recording**:
* Teachers can enter the final finishing place for each student in a race.
* The app validates that places are entered without gaps (e.g., 1, 2, 3 is valid; 1, 3 is not if only two participants).
* The app correctly handles ties in placings (e.g., if two students tie for 1st, the next place is 3rd).
  
**Result Viewing**:
* Teachers can view a list of all races and results.

## User Guide

1. Register students
2. Set up a race. Assign students to lanes (1 student per lane, minimum 2 students)
3. Record results. Enter the place of each student
4. View results

5. Any stage of the race creation process can be accessed from 'Manage Races'. From there students can be assigned to a race, results can be recorded, or a completed race can be viewed
